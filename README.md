## About Me

This webpage functions an informal personal **LinkedIn** for Code Fellows. The purpose is to allow other members of my Code Fellows cohort to read through my biographical information, education, and professional experience in order to have a better understanding of who I am as a person. Additionally, other cohort members will be able to look for commonalities with their own backgrounds and form a deeper sense of connection.

At the end of the webpage is an interactive quiz that asks **5** basic questions about me. Users will be able to click the "Take the Quiz" button and answer the Yes/No questions. The user's score is tracked and returned to them at the end of the quiz.

### Reflections and Comments

#### Learning Journal: 02

Today I think I had a breakthrough in understanding how to more effectively lay out my HTML documents so that they are easier to format with an external CSS stylesheet. By effectively utilizing `<section>` and `<div>` elements paired with the `id` and `class` attributes, respectively, I was able to structure the sections of the HTML file in a much easier to understand flow during my initial construction. This allowed me to simultaneously construct the layout of the CSS stylesheet and quickly iterate on formatting ideas as I moved from section to section.

Going forward, I think that this process of web design could be even more efficient if I spend time upfront wireframing the website. I have not done that during the last two labs and think that this is a critical piece of planning that I am not doing. Granted, I've been able to get away with not wireframing due to the simple nature of the sites, however, as the complexity of the websites I build grows, the more benefit I will derive from wireframing.

Communication is key when working with a partner, as is respecting roles. If driving, do not forge ahead of the Navigator. If Navigating, use clear language and verify that the Driver understands what you want executed before you let them start typing. If either person begins to work alone on a problem, then that defeats the point of Pair Programming.

Overall, today was a bit easier than the other days. I think at this point I have a general enough understanding of the relationships between HTML, CSS, and JS to actually build out a basic website and the troubleshoot it. Next steps for me are to continue to identify specific problems that I know can be solved with code, then go research how to actually build the code to solve that problem.
