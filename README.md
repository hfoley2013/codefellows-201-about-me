## About Me

This webpage functions an informal personal **LinkedIn** for Code Fellows. The purpose is to allow other members of my Code Fellows cohort to read through my biographical information, education, and professional experience in order to have a better understanding of who I am as a person. Additionally, other cohort members will be able to look for commonalities with their own backgrounds and form a deeper sense of connection.

At the end of the webpage is an interactive quiz that asks **5** basic questions about me. Users will be able to click the "Take the Quiz" button and answer the Yes/No questions. The user's score is tracked and returned to them at the end of the quiz.

### Reflections and Comments

Today I think I had a breakthrough in understanding how to more effectively lay out my HTML documents so that they are easier to format with an external CSS stylesheet. By effectively utilizing `<section>` and `<div>` elements paired with the `id` and `class` attributes, respectively, I was able to structure the sections of the HTML file in a much easier to understand flow during my initial construction. This allowed me to simultaneously construct the layout of the CSS stylesheet and quickly iterate on formatting ideas as I moved from section to section.

Going forward, I think that this process of web design could be even more efficient if I spend time upfront wireframing the website. I have not done that during the last two labs and think that this is a critical piece of planning that I am not doing. Granted, I've been able to get away with not wireframing due to the simple nature of the sites, however, as the complexity of the websites I build grows, the more benefit I will derive from wireframing.
